Whats new?

// Index.html
    - Main Menu
        - Nicer looking song selection button (the main button)
            - Lights up even more when hovered over
        - Changelog (shows newest and all previous updates)

// Song select
    - Less static feeling menu
        - Background pulses to BPM
        - Title hase dark transparent background
    - Added back button to return to the main menu
    - Two new songs to play until I get songs to load from a server
        - Spatium Cursu
        - Bad Apple!!

// Gameplay
    - Improved chart playability
        - Notes (specifically noticable on Cyberspace Abyss) can no longer been seen at the start of the chart
        - 3 second wait time before notes start rolling in (This also help reduce lag from the beginning of a chart)
        - Notes move and try to estimate their starting position so it doesn't look weird (So I don't have to have the notes teleport to their position when the song starts)

// Editor
    - Fixed editor (Again)
        - Chart can successfully be Imported
        - Tags no longer take up 90% (exaggeration) of the file size
            - Issue bc it kept re-adding tags to the tage list ever time the Json was updated, and for some reason counted blank or space characters

Whats new?

// Index.html
    - Main Menu
        - Access to editor and song selecting
        - Bouncing Icon of the game (It will have background audio and will sync with that BGM, I just don't have anything yet)
        - Other buttons showing what will be expected in the future of prosody

// Song select
    - Better song select
        - Blurred background and mini banner in the top left
        - Dynamic song selection
            - Use arrow keys to navigate the song selector ( <- Up || /\ Up || \/ Down || -> Down)
            - Audio plays from preview point
    - Chart info
        - Difficulty (Diff calculation will be adjusted later)
        - Total notes / Max combo
        - BPM (Audio's beats per minute)
        - NPS (Chart's notes per second)
    - Leaderboard (Doesn't show user scores... yet)
        - Shows people who worked on the game and did something notable or has been helping with it. (and contains some extra info on what they did to get there)

// Gameplay
    - Optimized notes (Charts can now support up to 3-4x the notes -> ~700 to ~3000 (Depends on computer and browser))
    - Improved score panel
        - Shows chart information (Ie. Artist, Creator, Etc.)

// Editor
    - Fixed editor
        - Json now is correctly shown and doesn't mess up when you place notes out of order
        - Json no longer visible / Json replaced with files
        - Chart can be Imported and Exported from and into a file
    - More editor options
        - Tags (Will be used for searching for charts when I get around to it)
        - Description (To add more information about the chart. What patterns does it contain? Any fun facts about this chart, song, or anything else? how many charts have you made and which one is this? Etc.)
        - Preview point (Where the song will start when in song selector -> Usually the besy or most catchy part to hook someone into playing the chart)
        - Chart testing (Opens a new tab where you can play the chart just like any other chart)
    - Criteria (This either lists the limitations to avoid errors when mapping so that it can be tested, or what is overall bad in charting)
        - File size (limit 5mb, files larger than this won't work on some browsers and this is to limit the size it'll take up when I make a server hosting these charts)

There are probably more changes, I changed/fixed/added A LOT. Sorry if I missed anything.
